The VIVO use case
The VIVO dataset represents scholars within academic enviroments. Ithas been built over an ontology that represents profesors, researchers, outcomes, organization,
etc. Several universities are part of the VIVO effort, this makes VIVO an authoritative data source because universities are mantaining 
the information. Although VIVO is not heavy on ORCIDs, some VIVO records do have an ORCID. For our project, ORCID, identifiers in general,
is an anchor that helps us to expand related triplets in our graph.
