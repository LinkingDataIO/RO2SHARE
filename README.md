# RO2SHARE
Digital assets are more valuable when they are part of a network rather than when they live in isolation. Assets related to research are not different. RO2SHARE delivers a curatorial infrastructure for Research Digital Assets, A.K.A Research objects. We aim to i) facilitate the definition of "ownership" over these assets and ii) make it possible for researchers to establish relations across these assets. We are using semantic web technology, e.g. RDF. The resulting data from the brief interaction between the end user and the digital assets being managed over our interface is open and it is exposed over our SPARQL endpoint. This project delivers data infrastructure, the GUI is just to demo whats behind; RO2SHARE does not focus on the UX, this will most likely be part of our future work. We are using SHARE data because it aggregates several sources; we are using ORCID API as our authoritative ID provider and validator.
